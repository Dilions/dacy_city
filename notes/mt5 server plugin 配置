mt4 server plugin 配置

配置成 release win32

general->
	Character Set: Use Unicode Character Set. The Unicode symbols set must be selected, as MetaTrader 5 servers support only such projects.
	Whole Program Optimization: Use Link Time Code Generation. This option should be used to speed up the application.


C/C++
	Debug Information Format: Disabled. Debugging data must be turned off, as the Release-project is being configured.

C/C++ | Optimization
	Optimization: Maximum Speed (/O2). Install this option to speed up the application.
	Inline Function Expansion: Any Suitable (/Ob2). Install this option to speed up the application.
	Enable Intrinsic Functions: Yes (/Oi). Install this option to speed up the application.

C/C++ | Code Generation
	Enable C++ Exceptions: No. It is recommended to disable exceptions, to prevent the appearance of unhandled exceptions that lead to crash of the trading server.
	Runtime Library: Multi-threaded (/MT). To avoid problems, connected with different version of the CRT library (Common Runtime Library) or its absence, it is recommended to use the static linking of CRT - /MT. When debugging, use the Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd) parameter.
	Buffer Security Check: No (/GS-). This option must be turned off to speed up the application.
	Enable Function-Level Linking: No. This option must be turned off to speed up the application.
	Enable Enhanced Instruction Set: Streaming SIMD Extension 2 (/arch:SSE2). SSE2 instructions set must be turned on to considerably speed up the application. This instructions set is supported by the most of the modern CPUs.

C/C++ | Language
	Enable Run-Time Type Info: No (/GR-). This option must be turned off, as in most cases runtime type identification (RTTI) is not used. RTTI support may slow down the program code execution.

Linker | Debugging
	Generate Debug Info: No. Debugging data generation must be turned off, as the Release version is being configured.
